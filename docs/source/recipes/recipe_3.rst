Genetic algorithm-driven graph exploration
==========================================

To simplify this example, which mirrors our
`recently published example <>`_, I am simply showing here how to explore graph
and building block configurations with a genetic algorihm, without any
molecular considerations. The fitness function here considers the energy of
the unrealistic carbon chain that we have generated.
