A general tool set for working with coarse-grained stk models.

The code can be installed as a library using `pip install -e .`.

Requires `stk`, `OpenMM` and `Shape`.

* `first_paper_example` contains the code to generate the cages and data for DOI:
* `generate_XX.py` generates cage structures for different topology sets.
* `env_set.py` sets a specific environment for file outputs.
* `plot_XX.py` produces images and figures, performs analysis.
